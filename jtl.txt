I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
(Take it to the bridge)

Dirty babe, you see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
(Take it to the chorus)

Come here girl, go ahead be gone with it
Come to the back, go ahead be gone with it
VIP, go ahead be gone with it
Drinks on me, go ahead be gone with it
Let me see what your twerkin' with, go ahead be gone with it
Look at those hips, go ahead be gone with it
You make me smile, go ahead be gone with it
Go 'head child, go ahead be gone with it
Get your sexy on, go ahead be gone with it (7x)
Get your sexy on.

I'm bringing sexy back
Them motherfuckers don't know how to act
Girl let me make up for all the things you lack
Cause you're burning up, I've got to get it fast
(Take it to the bridge)

Dirty babe, you see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
(Take it to the chorus)

Come here girl, go ahead be gone with it
Come to the back, go ahead be gone with it
VIP, go ahead be gone with it
Drinks on me, go ahead be gone with it
Let me see what your twerkin' with, go ahead be gone with it
Look at those hips, go ahead be gone with it
You make me smile, go ahead be gone with it
Go 'head child, go ahead be gone with it
Get your sexy on, go ahead be gone with it (7x)
Get your sexy on.

(You Ready?) (3x)

I'm bringing sexy back
Them motherfuckers watch how I attack
If that's your girl, better watch your back
Cause you're burning up for me, and that's a fact
(Take it to the chorus)

Come here girl, go ahead be gone with it
Come to the back, go ahead be gone with it

Go 'head child, go ahead be gone with it
Get your sexy on, go ahead be gone with it (7x)

Hey girl
I got something' real important to give you
So just sit down and listen

Girl you know we've been together such a long long time
(Such a long time)
And now I'm ready to lay it on the line
Wow, you know it's Christmas and my heart is open wide
(Open wide)
Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind
(What's on my mind)

A gift real special, so take off the top
Take a look inside it's my dick in a box
It's in a box

Not gonna get you a diamond ring
That sort of gift don't mean anything
Not gonna get you a fancy car
Girl, ya gotta know you're my shinin' star

Not gonna get you a house in the hills
A girl like you needs somethin' real
Wanna get you somethin' from the heart
Somethin' special girl

It's my dick in a box
My dick in a box babe
It's my dick in a box
Ooh, my dick in a box girl

See I'm wise enough to know
When a gift needs givin', and I got just the one
Somethin' to show ya that you are second to none

To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress
It's easy to do just follow these steps

1, cut a hole in a box
2, put your junk in that box
3, make her open the box
And that's the way you do it

It's my dick in a box
My dick in a box babe
It's my dick in a box
Ooh, my dick in a box girl

Christmas, dick in a box
Hanukkah, dick in a box
Kwanzaa, a dick in a box
Every single holiday a dick in a box

Over at your parents' house, a dick in a box
Mid-day at the grocery store, a dick in a box
Backstage at the CMA's, a dick in a box

My dick in a box
My dick in a box
My dick in a box
